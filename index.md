[The Official Liberal Conspiracy Website](https://theofficialliberalconspiracywebsite.com) was created to support my politics. I have endured enough ant-Democratic and conspiracy theory bumper stickers that I felt motivated to invest a few dollars in my response. It's all in fun and healthy politics so don't go out of your way to be offended.
